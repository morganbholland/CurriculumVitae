  title={The Role of Long-Term and Short-Term Risk in Relationship Banking},

  abstract={This paper explores the benefits firms may receive from relationship banking that arise from the information gleaned by banks through monitoring. If monitoring reveals not only current output, but also new information about future payoffs, lenders can shield themselves from future losses through early termination of lending agreements. In a competitive lending environment, banks shift the benefits of early termination to borrowers through the lending terms, improving not only the overall expected payoff of projects, but also the welfare of borrowers. Numerical results reveal that the benefits of long-term relationships based on the information revealed in monitoring could be substantial.}
