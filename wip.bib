author = {\textbf{Morgan Holland}},
abstract = {There are three distinct kinds of inequality affected by automation. \emph{Wage} inequality arises as the jobs performed by some workers are substituted by capital, while other jobs are created by, and complementary with capital. \emph{Income} inequality comes from not only wage inequality, but also higher returns to capital when automation occurs. Exacerbating income inequality is \emph{wealth} inequality, where those with higher wages and income are able to invest in automation capital at higher rates. I build a task-based model of automation that incorporates all three kinds of inequality. I match this model to U. S. data to determine the impact automation has had on inequality and to predict how future automation could affect inequality in the future. Finally, I explore policy that could reduce inequality from automation.}

	author = {Margaret Holland and \textbf{Morgan Holland}},
	abstract = {The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) was designed to decrease discrimination by employers against people with disabilities and thereby improve the earnings and employment of people with disabilities. Motivated by intersectionality, we use difference in differences to determine how the ADA affected disparities in employment and earnings differently for marginalized populations.}
