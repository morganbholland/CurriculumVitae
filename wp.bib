  title={Growth, Income Distribution and Political Economy Implications of Automation},

  abstract={We study the distributional consequences of automation in a model with two kinds of agents --- workers, who supply labor, and entrepreneurs, who own capital. We assume that production involves tasks that can be done by either capital or labor with varying productivity. We conceptualize automation as a shift in the relative productivity of capital at certain tasks that reduces the set of tasks done by labor. We contrast this with ``traditional technical progress'', which is an increase in capital productivity at tasks previously done by capital. We derive a simple condition that governs whether labor share goes to zero in the long run, for given tax rates. We then characterize the distributional consequences of a shift in technology, using a tractable case that allows us to cleanly distinguish between automation and traditional technological progress. Finally, we endogenize the tax rate by computing the political economy equilibrium under majority voting, where the government has access to a capital tax and a transfer to workers (a ``universal basic income''). We give conditions for zero or positive capital taxation in the steady state, and conditions under which workers prefer that the labor share go to zero and they derive income wholly from the UBI.}
